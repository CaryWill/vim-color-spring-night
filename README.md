Calm Spring Color Scheme for Vim
================================

`spring-night` is a low contrast calm color scheme for Vim.
It supports both GUI true colors and CUI 256 bit colors.

Note that this color scheme is under construction.
I'll fix many highlights incrementally and create a theme for [vim-airline][].
